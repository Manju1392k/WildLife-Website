        WildLife in History
      </h1>

      <div class="infobox w-screen h-[70rem] text-lg p-10 text-white font-bold">
        Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has
        come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without
        being introduced by humans.Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those
        birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in
        all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and
        other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct
        forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to
        animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that
        much wildlife is affected by human activities.Some wildlife threaten
        human safety, health, property, and quality of life. However, many wild
        animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value
        might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature. Humans have
        historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number
        of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals,
        however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such
        animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions
        declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for
        the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the
        exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment. Global
        wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of
        human activity, particularly overconsumption, population growth and
        intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living
        Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index
        measure, which is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth
        mass extinction event.According to CITES, it has been estimated that
        annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars
        and it affects hundreds of millions of animal and plant specimen.

          GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT CONTROL WILDLIFE
        </h1>

        Wildlife issues in the United States are overseen by various federal and
        state agencies. At the federal level, the USFWS is the primary agency.
        Originally called the U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries, the USFWS
        was formed in 1871 to examine problems with declining food-fish stocks
        and recommend remedies. In 1903 the agency was given oversight of the
        first national wildlife refuge, Pelican Island, a three-acre bird
        sanctuary in Sebastian, Florida. In "Wild Places, Wild Things" (2006,
        http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Horicon/documents/WildPlacesWildThings.pdf),
        the USFWS states that it manages 95 million acres in 545 refuges in the
        National Wildlife Refuge System. It also manages migratory bird
        conservation, oversees thousands of wetlands and other management areas,
        and operates dozens of national fish hatcheries, fishery resources
        offices, and ecological services field stations. The USFWS administers
        and enforces many federal wildlife laws and issues import and export
        permits under those laws. The USFWS works with the U.S. Customs and
        Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to monitor
        wildlife trade and stop illegal shipments of protected plants and
        animals. The USFWS also enforces the country's participation in the
        Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
        and Flora (CITES). This international agreement regulates the importing
        and exporting of thousands of species. Other federal agencies involved
        in controlling wild populations include the Wildlife Services (WS) of
        the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Bureau of Reclamation,
        and the National Park Service. The WS is the primary federal agency in
        charge of controlling wildlife that can damage agriculture, property,
        and natural resources or threaten public health and safety. It operates
        the National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins, Colorado.
