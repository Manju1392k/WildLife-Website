            Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that
            grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those
            birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests,
            rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have
            distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched
            by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.Some wildlife
            threaten human safety, health, property, and quality of life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous
            ones, have value to human beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.
            Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the
            legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes
            such animals as domesticated cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be
            sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against
            the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.
            Global wildlife populations have decreased by 68% since 1970 as a result of human activity, particularly
            overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, according to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund's Living
            Planet Report and the Zoological Society of London's Living Planet Index measure, which is further evidence
            that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event.According to CITES, it has been estimated that
            annually the international wildlife trade amounts to billions of dollars and it affects hundreds of millions
            of animal and plant specimen.

            <h1 class="text-center text-3xl font-bold text-white m-10">GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT CONTROL WILDLIFE</h1>

            Wildlife issues in the United States are overseen by various federal and state agencies. At the federal
            level, the USFWS is the primary agency. Originally called the U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries, the
            USFWS was formed in 1871 to examine problems with declining food-fish stocks and recommend remedies. In 1903
            the agency was given oversight of the first national wildlife refuge, Pelican Island, a three-acre bird
            sanctuary in Sebastian, Florida.
            In "Wild Places, Wild Things" (2006, http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Horicon/documents/WildPlacesWildThings.pdf),
            the USFWS states that it manages 95 million acres in 545 refuges in the National Wildlife Refuge System. It
            also manages migratory bird conservation, oversees thousands of wetlands and other management areas, and
            operates dozens of national fish hatcheries, fishery resources offices, and ecological services field
            stations. The USFWS administers and enforces many federal wildlife laws and issues import and export permits
            under those laws.
            The USFWS works with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
            monitor wildlife trade and stop illegal shipments of protected plants and animals. The USFWS also enforces
            the country's participation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
            Flora (CITES). This international agreement regulates the importing and exporting of thousands of species.
            Other federal agencies involved in controlling wild populations include the Wildlife Services (WS) of the
            U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Bureau of Reclamation, and the National Park Service. The WS is
            the primary federal agency in charge of controlling wildlife that can damage agriculture, property, and
            natural resources or threaten public health and safety. It operates the National Wildlife Research Center in
            Fort Collins, Colorado.
